## üìÜ Basics

### ‚úÖ What This Section Covers

- What Webpack is and why it's used
- What Webpack can do for your project
- The basic project structure

---

### üìù Explanation

Webpack is a **JavaScript module bundler**. It:

- Starts from an entry JS file (`src/index.js`)
- Follows all `import` and `require()` calls
- Bundles everything (JS, CSS, images, fonts) into a single/minified output (like `dist/bundle.js`)

But by default:

- ‚ùå It only understands `.js` files
- ‚ùå It does **not** convert modern JS (e.g., `?.`, `async/await`) for old browsers

---

## üåü What Webpack Can Do

Webpack is a powerful bundler that enhances modern web development by providing:

1. ‚úÖ **Loading different assets** like JavaScript, CSS, images, fonts, and more using loaders.
2. ‚úÖ **Building a dependency graph** starting from a single entry file.
3. ‚úÖ **Optimized production builds** with minification, compression, and tree-shaking.
4. ‚úÖ **Bundle splitting** for faster loading and lazy loading of features.
5. ‚úÖ **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** for instant updates during development.
6. ‚úÖ **Dead code elimination (tree shaking)** to remove unused code in production.
7. ‚úÖ **Module Federation** to enable micro frontends by sharing modules across apps (Webpack 5).
8. ‚úÖ **Caching support** using content hashing to avoid re-downloading unchanged code.
9. ‚úÖ **Duplicate code elimination** through smart dependency analysis and optimization.

### üîå Loaders

#### ‚ùì What is a Loader?

A **loader** in Webpack is a transformation tool that allows Webpack to process **non-JavaScript files** (like CSS, images, fonts, HTML, or even modern JS).

> Webpack only understands JS/JSON. Loaders tell Webpack how to **convert other file types into valid modules** it can include in the bundle.

#### üîç Purpose of Loaders

| Loader           | Purpose                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `css-loader`     | Lets you import `.css` files into your JS modules                       |
| `style-loader`   | Injects the imported CSS into the `<style>` tag inside the browser DOM  |
| `babel-loader`   | Connects Babel to Webpack to transpile modern JS syntax                 |
| `file-loader`    | Emits files (images, fonts, etc.) to output folder and returns the path |
| `url-loader`     | Same as file-loader but can inline files as base64 URLs                 |
| `html-loader`    | Allows importing `.html` files as strings into JS                       |
| `asset/resource` | Native Webpack 5 way to handle files without file-loader                |

Loaders are declared under the `module.rules` section in `webpack.config.js`.

### ÔøΩüóÇÔ∏è Lesson: `assetModuleFilename` & `clean` in Webpack

In this lesson, we learn how to control **output asset paths** and **clean the build directory** before each build.

---

#### 1. `assetModuleFilename`

The `assetModuleFilename` option in `output` tells Webpack **where and how to store asset files** (like images, fonts, videos, etc.) when they're emitted to the `dist` folder.

**Example:**

```js
output: {
  filename: 'bundle.js',
  path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  assetModuleFilename: 'assets/[hash][ext]'
}
```

- `[hash]` ‚Äì A unique hash based on the file's content. Helps with cache-busting.
- `[ext]` ‚Äì The original file extension (.png, .woff, etc.).
- `assets/` ‚Äì The folder where the assets will be placed.

So, if you import an image `logo.png`, it could be saved as:

```bash
dist/assets/4f2a7d9.png
```

**Separating Images & Fonts**

We can have different output folders for different asset types using rules + `generator`:

```js
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      test: /\.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif|svg)$/i,
      type: "asset/resource",
      generator: {
        filename: "assets/images/[hash][ext]",
      },
    },
    {
      test: /\.(woff|woff2|eot|ttf|otf)$/i,
      type: "asset/resource",
      generator: {
        filename: "assets/fonts/[hash][ext]",
      },
    },
  ];
}
```

‚úÖ Images go to `assets/images/`
‚úÖ Fonts go to `assets/fonts/`

> **Q: Why not just use assetModuleFilename globally?**
>
> You can, but it applies to all assets. If you want different folders for images, fonts, videos, etc., you use per-rule `generator.filename` instead.

---

#### 2. `clean` in Webpack

When you build repeatedly, the `dist` folder can get cluttered with old unused files.

`clean: true` automatically removes everything in the output folder before each build.

**Example:**

```js
output: {
  filename: 'bundle.js',
  path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  clean: true
}
```

üìå Without `clean`, unused files from old builds stay in `dist`.
üìå With `clean: true`, your build starts with a fresh, empty folder every time.

---

#### 3. Real-world Q&A

> **Q: What if I have static files in dist that I don‚Äôt want to delete?**
>
> Then don‚Äôt use `clean: true`. Instead, use a copy plugin to move necessary files during each build.

> **Q: Can I have both assetModuleFilename and generator.filename?**
>
> Yes. `assetModuleFilename` is the default for all assets, and `generator.filename` can override it for specific file types.

### üé® Asset Loaders (Webpack 5)

Asset loaders in Webpack 5 provide flexible ways to handle files like images, fonts, and text. Here are the main types:

#### 1. üéØ `asset/resource`

Emits the asset as a separate file in the output folder and returns the public URL.

**Use Case:**

- Images, fonts, and media files that should be stored separately.

**Config:**

```js
{
  test: /\.(png|jpg|woff2?|ttf|eot)$/i,
  type: 'asset/resource'
}
```

**Output:**

- File is emitted to `dist/` with a hashed filename.
- JS import returns a URL string you can use.

> ‚ùó **Common Mistake:**
>
> Using `use` instead of `type`:
>
> ```js
> use: "asset/resource"; // ‚ùå Incorrect
> type: "asset/resource"; // ‚úÖ Correct
> ```

---

#### 2. üßµ `asset/inline`

Inlines the asset content as a Base64-encoded string into the JS bundle.

**Use Case:**

- Tiny assets like icons or fonts that benefit from inlining (fewer HTTP requests).

**Config:**

```js
{
  test: /\.svg$/i,
  type: 'asset/inline'
}
```

**Output:**

```js
const icon = "data:image/svg+xml;base64,...";
```

- Directly usable in `<img src={icon}>`

---

#### 3. üìú `asset/source`

Imports the raw source of a file as a string.

**Use Case:**

- SVGs, markdown, or text files where you need the file contents inside JS.

**Config:**

```js
{
  test: /\.txt$/i,
  type: 'asset/source'
}
```

**Output:**

```js
import text from "./note.txt";
console.log(text); // Logs file contents
```

---

#### 4. üß† `asset` (Smart Auto Mode)

Automatically selects between `asset/resource` and `asset/inline` based on file size.

**Use Case:**

- General-purpose image loading with performance control.

**Config:**

```js
{
  test: /\.png$/i,
  type: 'asset',
  parser: {
    dataUrlCondition: {
      maxSize: 4 * 1024 // 4kb
    }
  }
}
```

**Behavior:**

- Files < 4kb ‚Üí inlined as Base64
- Files ‚â• 4kb ‚Üí emitted as separate file

---

### üßê Babel

Webpack **bundles** JS. Babel **transpiles** modern JS into older JS that older browsers can run.

Example:

```js
const name = user?.name ?? "Guest";
```

‚Üí Babel will convert this to compatible ES5 code for browsers that don‚Äôt support `?.` or `??`.

You connect Babel to Webpack using `babel-loader`.

> Babel is usually configured in a `.babelrc` or `babel.config.js` file in the project root.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è When Do You Need Webpack?

You need Webpack when:

- ‚úÖ Running a build: `npm run build`
- ‚úÖ Using a dev server like `webpack-dev-server` or Vite
- ‚úÖ Working with `import`, JSX, SCSS, etc.

---

### ‚ùå What Happens Without Webpack?

If you skip Webpack:

- Browsers can‚Äôt understand:

  - `import` / `require()`
  - JSX, SCSS, font/image imports
  - Optional chaining, `async/await`, etc.

- Result: **Syntax errors**, broken UI, or blank screens

---

### üè† HTML Files in Webpack

Browsers need an `index.html` to load the app. Webpack doesn‚Äôt generate this by default.

You have 2 options:

1. Manually create `dist/index.html` and link the script
2. Use **HtmlWebpackPlugin** to:

   - Auto-generate `dist/index.html`
   - Inject the bundled script tag (`<script src="bundle.js">`) for you
   - Use a custom HTML template with `template: './src/template.html'`

---

## ‚ùì Doubts & Clarifications (Q\&A Style)

> These are real questions and clarifications raised while learning Webpack. They‚Äôre grouped by topic for easy reference.

### üì• Entry & Output

> üí¨ **Q: Why does Webpack expect a `.js` file as entry, not `.html`?** > **A:** Because Webpack bundles _JavaScript modules_, not HTML. `index.html` is the container, but `index.js` is the starting point of the app logic.

> üí¨ **Q: I used `index.html` as the entry point in `webpack.config.js` and got an error ‚Äî why?** > **A:** Webpack expects the entry point to be JavaScript. Using an HTML file will throw a parse error unless processed by an appropriate loader.

### üß† Babel & Modern JS

> üí¨ **Q: I wrote modern JS (like optional chaining). It failed in the browser but worked in Node. Why?** > **A:** Node (with `"type": "module"` or `.mjs`) supports many modern features directly. But the browser may not, especially if it's older or strict. That's why Babel is needed for compatibility.

> üí¨ **Q: What does `"presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]` do in `.babelrc`?** > **A:** It tells Babel to figure out **which modern JS features need transpiling**, based on the target environments (like older browsers or Node versions). It's a smart preset.

> üí¨ **Q: Does Babel check the browser and transpile accordingly at runtime?** > **A:** ‚ùå No. Babel transpiles at **build time**, based on what **you configure** (like `targets: "> 0.25%"`). The browser just receives already-converted JS.

> üí¨ **Q: I removed Babel loader and used modern JS. Build worked, but browser gave syntax error. Why?** > **A:** Because Webpack **only bundles** ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt convert JS. You need Babel to make the syntax compatible. Without it, the browser crashes at runtime if it can't understand the code.

> üí¨ **Q: I used `import` and `export` in my JS files, didn‚Äôt configure Babel, but it still worked in the browser. How is that possible?** > **A:** Because **Webpack understands `import/export`** and internally converts it into a custom module format (`__webpack_require__`). That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt need Babel just for modules.

> üí¨ **Q: I created a project using `import/export` (ES6) without Babel and it worked ‚Äî how?** > **A:** Webpack itself handles `import`/`export` syntax and converts it to its internal module system. But it does **not** transpile newer JavaScript features ‚Äî that's Babel‚Äôs job.

> üí¨ **Q: What does the `title` and `template` in `HtmlWebpackPlugin` do?** > **A:**
>
> - `title`: Sets the `<title>` tag in the generated HTML
> - `template`: Uses a custom HTML file (`src/template.html`) as a base instead of auto-generating a blank page

> üí¨ **Q: Then how does my React app work even without Webpack or Babel?** > **A:** If you're using **Create React App (CRA)**, you're using a package called `react-scripts`. It wraps Webpack, Babel, and many other tools. You don‚Äôt see the configs, but they‚Äôre used under the hood.

> üí¨ **Q: What is `react-scripts`?** > **A:** It‚Äôs a prebuilt config used by CRA to hide complexity. It includes Webpack, Babel, ESLint, Jest, and more. You can eject it with `npm run eject` if you want full control.

### üßë‚Äçüè´ CSS Loader Doubt

> üí¨ **Q: What happens if I use only `css-loader` without `style-loader`?** > **A:** Your build will work, but styles won‚Äôt show up in the browser. `css-loader` parses the CSS file into JS. `style-loader` is needed to inject that CSS into the DOM. Without it, no visual style will be applied.

### üé® Fonts in Webpack

#### ‚úÖ What This Lesson Covers

- What font formats exist and which to use
- How to load local fonts with Webpack
- When and why to use `asset/resource`
- What happens when you don‚Äôt configure anything
- Real-world Q&A and debugging notes

---

#### üì¶ What Font Formats Can Webpack Handle?

| Format | Extension | Use Case                              |
| ------ | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| WOFF   | .woff     | Web standard                          |
| WOFF2  | .woff2    | Optimized for web ‚Äî preferred         |
| TTF    | .ttf      | TrueType Font (older but still works) |
| EOT    | .eot      | Used mostly for Internet Explorer     |
| OTF    | .otf      | Less common, extended format          |

---

#### üß† Q&A Style Learnings

**‚ùìQ: How does Webpack handle fonts? Do we need a loader?**

üî• **A:** In Webpack 5, no special loader is needed! Webpack uses its Asset Modules system to detect files like `.woff2` and automatically uses:

```js
type: "asset/resource";
```

That means:

- It copies the font file to `dist/`
- Replaces the `url(...)` in your CSS with the final path

**‚ùìQ: What if I didn‚Äôt configure anything ‚Äî but my font still loaded? How?!**

üò≤ **Surprise!** Webpack did the work behind the scenes.

Here's what happened:

You wrote CSS:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "MyFont";
  src: url("./assets/fonts/my-font.woff2");
}
```

You imported CSS in JS:

```js
import "./styles.css";
```

Webpack magic:

- üß† `css-loader` reads the `url()` ‚Üí tells Webpack: ‚Äúthis is a dependency!‚Äù
- üõ†Ô∏è Webpack checks the file extension `.woff2`
- üßû Webpack says: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see a special rule‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll just use `asset/resource`.‚Äù
- üìÇ Webpack copies the file to `dist/` and fixes the URL in CSS
- ‚úÖ You didn‚Äôt do anything. It just worked.

**‚ùìQ: Should I still add a rule in webpack.config.js?**

üß© **Yes, if you want control.**

For example:

```js
{
  test: /\.(woff|woff2|eot|ttf|otf)$/i,
  type: 'asset/resource',
  generator: {
    filename: 'fonts/[name][ext]',
  }
}
```

This gives you:

- Organized output (e.g., `dist/fonts/my-font.woff2`)
- No hash filenames
- Easier debugging

**‚ùìQ: Why not use asset/inline for fonts?**

üìõ Don‚Äôt do it (unless the font is tiny)

- Inline fonts are embedded in JS as base64 ‚Üí increases bundle size
- Fonts are usually large
- Let the browser load them separately (using `asset/resource`)

---

#### üíª Demo Setup Summary

**Project Structure:**
